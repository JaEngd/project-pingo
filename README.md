# Project Pingo

The idea is that insted of providing all the known spots on google maps, the users starts on a blank page and fills out the map with their hidden spots. For example "My favorite fishing lake" or "The greatest goat farm ever".

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
